The Moto X name has been associated with Motorola's flagship smartphones ever
since the original X was lauched over two year ago. The Moto X was a good phone
that was let down by tis poor camera and battery life, though its successor fixed 
the battery problem to a large extent.
2015 represents a dilution of the Moto X brand, first with the launch of the 'super
flagShip' Moto Turbo, and more recently, the unveiling of not one, but two new Moto
X smartphones - the Moto X play and the Moto X Style. The latter is closer to Mto X's
flagship ethos, while the Play is a mid-raqnge offering by todays standards. So how does
Moto X play perform in the real world? let's find out.
The Moto X Play is another solid, good looking phone from the Motorola's stables.
The phone is pretty traditional in its design and layout, apart from the SIM-plus-microSD 
tray that sits on the top edge. The tray pops out to reveal two nano SIM slots on
one side and space for a microSD card on the other. We quite liked this idea, but if you
are someone who likes to pop microSD cards in and out frequently, you may be perturbed by
the fact you will lose cellular coverage every time you do that.
The back cover can be removed to get a gleimpse of the massive battery. However, the 
Moto X Play is missing water resistance, which is a disapointmnet, especially considering 
that's one of the features we really liked in the more affordable Moto G3rd generation (Review).
The Play, however, does come with a "water-repellent coating".
The Moto X Play comes with a 5.5-inch full-HD display that looks good and is bright  enough to
get its jobs done even outdoors. The viewing angles are dencent and overall we have no complaints
about the screen on the Moto X.
